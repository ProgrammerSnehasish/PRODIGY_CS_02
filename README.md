# PRODIGY_CS_02
This repository contains a Pixel Manipulation Image Encryption Tool that allows users to encrypt and decrypt images using pixel-based transformations. The encryptio is performed by modifying pixel values through simple mathematical operations or swapping techniques.

# Pixel Manipulation for Image Encryption

## **Overview**
This project is a simple **image encryption tool** that manipulates pixel values to provide a basic level of encryption. The encryption process involves modifying each pixel by applying a mathematical operation. The same method is used to decrypt the image.

## **Features**
- Encrypts images by modifying pixel values.
- Decrypts images using the same method.
- Simple GUI interface for user interaction.
- Supports **PNG, JPG, and BMP** formats.

## **Installation**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ProgrammerSnehasish/PRODIGY_CS_02.git
